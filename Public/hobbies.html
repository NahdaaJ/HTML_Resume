    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <p>I have absolutely loved gaming since I got my PC in 2019! I have played the following games since then on either
        PC or on my Nintendo Switch:</p>

        <li>League of Legends</li>
        <li>Animal Crossing</li>
        <li>Ori and the Blind Forest</li>
        <li>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</li>
        <li>Pokemon Violet</li>
        <li>Disney Dreamlight Valley</li>
        <li>Monster Hunter World</li>
        <li>Skyrim</li>
        <li>Minecraft</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Baking</h2>
    <p>When the pandemic happened in early 2020, I decided to learn baking as a hobby to pass time! I absolutely love
        sweet treats and baking things for those around me! I have made:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Brownies</li>
        <li>Cupcakes</li>
        <li>Macarons</li>
        <li>Sugar Cookies</li>
        <li>Crinkle Cookies</li>
        <li>Meringues</li>
        <li>Chocolate Chip Cookies</li>
        <li>Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Art</h2>
    <p>I have enjoyed art and the creative field since I was a child! I really enjoy how peaceful and relaxing it can be
        to draw after a stressful day. I love to express myself!</p>
    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>I find coding projects really fun, and I love the end result! I feel such a strong sense of achievement that I
        always want to do more! This enjoyment is the reason I have decided to learn various different languages and
        softwares, outside of those taught at uni. </p>
