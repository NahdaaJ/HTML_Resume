    <h2>Personal Projects</h2>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/NahdaaJ/HTML_Resume">This Resume!</a></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>This resume is my first HTML5 project! I am using this project to learn and understand the fundamentals of
            HTML5.</li>
        <li>A HTML script was created in VS Code.</li>
        <li>A folder was created for assets such as images.</li>
        <li>Another folder was created to hold the other html pages that the main resume would link to.</li>
        <li>Each page was filled with the appropriate content. The pages were formatted and hyperlinked using HTML5
            tags.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/NahdaaJ/PasswordManager">Password Manager</a></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>A basic password manager script was initially created using PyCharm. Initially, the script prompted the user
            to enter a master username and password to access the password manager. After validation of the password,
            the script allowed the user to add passwords to a storage, view the passwords in the storage or quit the
            program.</li>
        <li>If the user input the master password incorrectly 3 times, the script would record the date and time as a
            breach in a separate file.</li>
        <li>The feature to delete a password from the password storage was added next.</li>
        <li>The view password feature was then upgraded so the user could either view a single password or all of the
            stored passwords.</li>
        <li>The next feature to be added was a strong password generator, which would generate another password if the
            user asked it to.</li>
        <li>The view password and delete password features were updated to let the user know if a password did not
            exist. The ability to cancel an action was aslo implemented.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>University Projects</h2>
    <h3><a>Third Year Individual Project</a></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The title of this project was “Forecasting Geomagnetic Storms Using NARX Neural Networks” and a brief was
            provided.</li>
        <li>A Gantt chart was created to aid in planning the project and research.</li>
        <li>Research was conducted for the topic background and current methods of solving the problem.</li>
        <li>Data was imported, preprocessed and cleaned in Excel.</li>
        <li>A NARX algorithm was created in MATLAB to predict future output values given past input values.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a>Robot Manipulator Team Project</a></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A model of the robot manipulator was created in MATLAB.</li>
        <li>Forward kinematics were explored to calculate the transformation matrix of the manipulators home position.
        </li>
        <li>Inverse kinematics were explored to test the end position of the manipulator, given that the joints had
            random configurations.</li>
        <li>Different forms of motor jogging were explored to perform coordinated movements.</li>
        <li>The robot arm manipulator was programmed to pick up cubes and other foam shapes from one space and place
            them in a specified configuration.</li>
    </ul>
