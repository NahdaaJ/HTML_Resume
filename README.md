# HTML Resume
*A project to practice my HTML skills.*

## Project Description
This resume was created as a way to practice everything I have learnt so far using HTML5. It doesn't include CSS or JavaScript, it is a simple HTML file.

There is a "home page" which is the resume itself. It displays my name using < h1 > tags. It then displays an image of me using the < img > tag. Every section heading uses < h2 > tags, and they are sectioned off using < hr >. Other relevant pages are hyperlinked near the bottom, using < a > tags. Right at the bottom, a < footer > is created to display fake copyright information.

On some of the relevant pages, I linked my GitHub and/or LinkedIn using < a > tags.

## Credits
This resume was a capstone project for a [Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) that I am doing on Udemy. I have learnt so much so far!

## Notes
Tags in this readme are shown with extra spaces as to not ruin the formatting!! :)
